# Universe Expansion Simulation with CPL Parameterization

**Project Description:**
The geometry and evolution of the Universe is determined by a set of components, matter, radiation, dark energy and curvature. The equation of state parameter for dark energy (according to the currently accepted lambda-CDM model) is a constant of -1. However, it has been proposed that the equation of state may vary with the scale factor of the Universe, a(t), and hence with time. We intend to use the CPL parameterization (which describes a non-constant equation of state) to model how the Universe would expand.

**Planned Directory Structure:**

Top level file: demo.py - Example of the project running

Subdirectory files: visualization.py - Runs the visualizations which display the parameter sliders and resulting plots.
                    solver.py - Includes all of the numerical calculations needed for the simulation
